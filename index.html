<a href="ws/aboutme.html"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>Everyday I bring the best to work. I work vigorously to earn and
keep customer trust. Explore new ideas without settling for what
I already know, look for new ideas from everywhere, working
with openness and honesty. I have strong judgment and good
instincts. I seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm my
own beliefs. I work as a partner, inside and outside. Always
learning and always seeking to improve myself. I am curious
about new possibilities and act to explore them. I work with
discipline and precision. continually raising the bar and drive to
deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. I ensure
that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are
fixed so they stay fixed. I accept responsibility to own how I and
my Team work and the results we create. I focus on the key
inputs and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely
fashion. I listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others
respectfully. I am self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or
embarrassing. Always benchmark myself and my team against the
best.</p>
